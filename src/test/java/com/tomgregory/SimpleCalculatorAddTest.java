================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The 'add' method is public and can be accessed by any class. This might not be a security issue in this specific context, but exposing methods unnecessarily can lead to potential security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Consider making methods private or protected unless they need to be accessed externally. In this case, if the 'add' method should be accessible only within the class, it should be declared as private.

Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: The 'add' method does not check for integer overflow. If the sum of 'a' and 'b' exceeds the maximum value that an int can hold, it will lead to incorrect results and potential vulnerabilities.
Solution: Consider adding checks for integer overflow. This can be done by comparing the result of the addition to the inputs. If the result is less than either of the inputs, an overflow has occurred.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for normal integers
Details:
  TestName: testAddWithNormalIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check the addition functionality of the add method with normal integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two integer values.
  Act: Invoke the add method with the provided integers.
  Assert: Compare the actual result with the expected result.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly adds two normal integers. The expected result is the sum of the two integers. This test is significant in validating the basic functionality of the add method.

Scenario 2: Test for negative integers
Details:
  TestName: testAddWithNegativeIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check the add method's functionality with negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide two negative integer values.
  Act: Invoke the add method with the provided integers.
  Assert: Compare the actual result with the expected result.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly adds two negative integers. The expected result is the sum of the two integers. This test is significant in ensuring the add method can handle negative integers.

Scenario 3: Test for zero
Details:
  TestName: testAddWithZero
  Description: This test is meant to check the add method's functionality when one or both of the parameters are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide zero and another integer.
  Act: Invoke the add method with the provided integers.
  Assert: Compare the actual result with the expected result.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly adds an integer and zero. The expected result is the non-zero integer. This test is significant in ensuring the add method can handle zero as one of its parameters.

Scenario 4: Test for maximum integer values
Details:
  TestName: testAddWithMaxIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check the add method's functionality when given the maximum integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide the maximum integer value for both parameters.
  Act: Invoke the add method with the provided integers.
  Assert: Check for arithmetic overflow.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the method can handle arithmetic overflow when adding maximum integer values. This test is significant in ensuring the add method can handle edge cases involving maximum integer values.

Scenario 5: Test for minimum integer values
Details:
  TestName: testAddWithMinIntegers
  Description: This test is meant to check the add method's functionality when given the minimum integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide the minimum integer value for both parameters.
  Act: Invoke the add method with the provided integers.
  Assert: Check for arithmetic underflow.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the method can handle arithmetic underflow when adding minimum integer values. This test is significant in ensuring the add method can handle edge cases involving minimum integer values.
